> Internet of Things Bay was a full-stack e-commerce web application built as the final project for 'Introduction into Software Development' at UTS. The site housed the abilty to purchase products, manage users and login.

Being my first proper taste of web development beyond the basic use HTML and CSS, this project was an eye-opening experience working with APIs, server side rendering and MVC architecture. I'd say this project kick started my interest in modern web-development practices and really taught me the origins of web development and its evolution to what it is today.

Being a group task, each member was in charge of a section of the website alongside a team presentation.

#### The tech stack which we used included:

- Bootstrap CSS Styling
- JavaBean and Servlets
- JSP for Server Side Rendering
- GlassFish Server on JavaEE
- Apache Derby SQL Database

#### For this project I was tasked in:

- #### Administration Page
  A Dashboard for Administration users to access customer and staff information as well as perform customer modifications inluding editing details and deactivating accounts.
- #### Admininstration APIs
  A set of Administration APIs which required authorisation to access. This included the CRUD operations to customers, updating a user to staff memmber and activating and deactiving accounts. These APIs would manipulate the SQL server.
- #### Customer Registration Form
  A form on the customer registration page with server side validation of correct user details such as email and phone numbers.

Working on such a large scale project early within University was a great experience, meeting new friends and helping each other along the way. The final presentation was a moment of pride, showcasing the hardwork we all put in and a testament to all the different aspects of web development we aquired such as working in Agile, working in a shared git repository and overall, creating a cohesive team environment.
