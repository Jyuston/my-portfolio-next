> Siteception?! This is about the portfolio you are currently viewing! ðŸ¤¯

This portfolio was a refreshing project after not working on an individual project for quite a while. It was the first time using Tailwind CSS and was an awesome experience after using similar CSS Frameworks such as Chakra UI which implements a similar in-line styling experience.

#### The Tech Stack Includes:

- NextJS for Sever side rendering
- Tailwind for an augmented styling experience
- Content Layer for generating javescript objects to use from Markdown
- HeadlessUI as a component library
- Vercel for Hosting

I love the implementation of a content SDK such as ContentLayer to generate site content as it allows me to very easily include future projects by just creating a new markdown file. This will result it a new page for the project in addtion to it appearinng in the drop down and project list.

My initial plan was to have a database which would store all project data, however I believe this is a more efficient and streamlined approach to suit the needs of my portfolio without the need for requests to a server. To view my experience with APIs and back-end development, visit some of my other projects such as Pinki!

I plan to maintain this portfolio for any future projects I may pursue so keep it bookmarked! ðŸ’–
