> Element Education is a simple web page for a private tutoring service developed in WordPress.
> It was created amongst some friends during University break and was my first exposure working on a real-world project for a client.

Having used a CMS only for personal experiments, using WordPress was a great learning experience in a professional setting.

In addition to using WordPress, we were also involved in the brand design process, using Figma to create mock-ups and brand artifacts. Using WordPress however hindered our creative ability with stricter templating rules than a custom webpage.

The following tasks & deliverables were completed:

- Brand design including Logo and colour scheme
- Website design with Call-to-Action button
- About, Contact & Testimonial Pages
- Email Plugin to notify client email on contact request via the website form.

Many basic skills such as working within a team and organising time effective solution for a client were practiced and I was glad that such an opportunity was available during University.
We learnt that Wordpress although being quick, easy and effective for our usecase, does have its development limitations and began looking into alternatives such as a headless CMS (Strapi) for future CMS Projects.
