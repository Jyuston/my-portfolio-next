> The Movie DB is a exactly what the name suggests... A database of Movies! It was created for the 'Advanced Software Design' subject at UTS featuring a couple unqiue features such as the ability to save custom groups of your movies and actors, search movies and review them!

The Movie DB was a later project I worked upon, using my experience from previous projects and experimenting with new tools and architecture. Utilising a public Movie API, our application displayed such data in a easy to use and interactive way with the addition to custom features.

#### The Tech Stack Included:

- NextJS
- React w/ Typescript
- ChakraUI (Component Library)
- React Query (Data Fetching)
- MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
- Prisma (ORM)
- Firebase Auth (Login)
- Vercel (Hosting)
- Azure Pipelines (Test Automation)
- Jest (Unit Testing)

#### For this Project I was tasked in:

- #### Movie Group Feature

  The End-to-End Movie Group Feature which involved a private movie group page per user, the ability to create multiple groups with multiple movies and adding movies from various screens using re-usable components.

- #### Acting Group Feature

  The End-to-End Acting Group Feature which involved a private movie group page per user, the ability to create multiple groups with multiple actors and adding actors from various screens using re-usable components.

The MovieDB was a great project which futher extended my knowledge of web development. The main learnings included the use of an ORM for aid in accessing data as well as the use of react-query and its ability to refrsh and invalidate expired data whilst providing an improved user experience. It was also the first time using a test library to ensure functionality of the website.

The MovieDB was a great project which further enhanced my web development knowledge and was great fun to see during development as the data from relevant movies began to appear! The Team was awesome to work with and working with Azure tools was great insight.
