During my time at CSR Connect as a Quality Assurance & Dev-Ops Engineer, I have learnt many valuable skills through my responsibilities of orchestrating the E2E release management process, reviewing and approving development PRs as well as participating in numerous codebase deep-dives to trace bugs.

#### As a QA, I have:

- Owned the development of integration and E2E automation tests using Cypress and MS Test
- Automated the execution of tests which are run daily and upon push via GitHub Actions.
- Tested and Documented new and existing functionality
- Ensured the health of various environments through monitoring

#### As a DevOps Engineer, I have:

- Maintained and developed deployment pipelines using Octopus Deploy, GitHub Actions, TeamCity
- Utilised various AWS Products including EC2, SQS and CloudWatch.
- Orchestrated release management

#### With an interest in Full Stack Development, I have:

- Assisted in the migration from AngularJS to Angular
- Developed re-usable components as part of a shared component library
- Assisted in the development of back-end functionality using .NET.

Being part of CSR Connect has continued to be a valuable experience, working amongst a team of supportive and motivated individuals as part of my early career.
Having the opportunity to undertake impactful responsibilities and lead various development initiatives has matured my work ethic and enabled me to become an even better team member.
