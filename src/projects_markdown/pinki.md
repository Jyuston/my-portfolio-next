> Pinki is a promise keeping web application created for my final project in "Advanced Software Development" at UTS. Users are able to log promises of owning and owed, as well as create public requests tracked with image proof and a fun reward system.

> A detailed technical write-up is available in the Git repository. Check it out using the link above!

Pinki was a large leap in my web development journey, learning and utilising more modern web development frameworks and techniques. It was the first time using React within a group project as well as NextJS and Typescript.

#### The Tech Stack Included:

- NextJS JAM Stack
- React w/ Typecsript
- ChakraUI (Component Library) + Framer Motion
- SWR Library (Data Fetching)
- MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
- Firebase Auth (Login)
- Firebase Storage (Images)
- Vercel (Hosting)

#### For this Project I was tasked in:

- #### Request Feature

  The End-to-End Request feature which involved a public request page, request form, image upload and reward distribution.

- #### Reward Selection Components

  A set of Re-usable components for Reward Selection for both request and favours.

- #### Caching and Performance

  Utilisation of NextJS and SWR to provide an enhanced user experience via functionality such as optimistic UI updates and a combination of Incremental Static Regeneration and Server Side Rendering when applicable.

Pinki was a awesome project which really accelerated my knowledge in web development and modern web practices. I was facinated by the different tools which were available to developers to aid the the Developer AND User experience as well as increase the performance of a website.

In addition to technical knowledge, Pinki as helped me develop a great working pace, utilising the Agile Methodology during development and using Gitflow with PR and Issue usage. I was so glad in what we achieved as a group and am most proud of this project!
